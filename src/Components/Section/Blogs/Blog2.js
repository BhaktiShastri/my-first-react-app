            From starting off as a girl-wonder who hit an unbeaten century on ODI debut at 17, to becoming the linchpin of India's line-up, Raj has piled up extraordinary numbers that could give most of the male counterparts in the same league a run for their money. Her tally of 5614 runs* in 155 innings includes five centuries, five knocks that finished in 90s - four of them undefeated - and 38 other fifties; and all that at an average above 50. She's 378 runs away from overtaking Charlotte Edwards who sits atop the all-time highest run-getters' list in the format. Yet, after years of continued excellence in top-flight cricket, the hunger to improvise doesn't fade.

"I just want to keep improving my game. I don't want to be a stagnated player. There has to be some improvement in my game everyday," Raj notes. "I have always believed right from the beginning [that] as a batsman, whenever I walk in to bat, I always have to score runs, irrespective of which level I play or who the opponent is. Whether it is domestic, international or league match, it doesn't matter to me. Every match, as a batter, should count. Every innings of mine should count.

"That's also because every innings which I have played has given me confidence. You learn from every time you walk in to bat. So I know, because it is not going to be a career which will be a lasting one - at some point everybody will have to hang their boots - and that when I do, I don't [want to] have any regrets that, you know, I could have tried this, or I could have done that better. That is the reason why I give everything I have for every match."
Fifteen years into her international career, when she was at the top of her game, easily the most recognised face in the country and bracketed amongst the best globally, Raj was pushed into opening for India in T20 cricket. Raj is a no-frills option, a proper textbook cricketer - a trait that, probably, single-handedly rules you out of contention for an opener's slot in a format that requires madness. Reluctant at first, Raj took up the challenge and, as the numbers will tell you, aced it.

"I believe the best always needs to be proven time and again," Raj says nonchalantly.<p> "If you're No.1, you have more challenges than the average player. The tough situations, pressure, the expectations would be more for the top-most player than an average player. And, as a player, you always want to be challenged. You always need to keep proving time and again, so I think that's the best part of being here. You'll never get time to relax."

Seven of her 10 international half-centuries in the format have come since her promotion in 2014. Perfectionist to the core, Raj swapped slots in the Railways line-up as well. The hundred against Hyderabad - first-ever in women's domestic T20s - in the recently concluded Super League T20 is testimony to the hard yards she has put in to remodel her act. All this while Raj could have chosen to confine herself to the the comforts of the middle-order where she had settled in.

"[Challenges], I feel, are actually the thing that propel the good players to keeping improving themselves. If there was no pressure, probably I wouldn't be the player that I am today," she adds humbly.

The fame and adulation, however, was not earned without hardships. </p>Overlooked for the 1997 World Cup despite top-scoring in the selection matches, 14-year-old Raj took solace from the fact that her runs and skill set stood out.

"The reason I was told [was] that I was to young to represent India in the World Cup at 14 years; that I wouldn't be able to take the pressure of a World Cup. That itself gave me the confidence that it was not because of my ability as the player, but it was for a completely different reason. Yes, I was really disappointed that I did not make the cut then, but... [in the meantime] I turned into a more confident player when I represented India in the 2000 World Cup."

Debuting in her teens, Raj's teammates were all well-established icons of the sport, and nearly double her age. But the rate at which she went about accumulating runs, even at that young age, helped her break the ice and settle in. With her bat doing all the talking, the quiet girl grew in confidence.

The meltdown happened years later when the runs dried up. A rare failure, on two different accounts, had Raj searching for answers. "There were a couple of times, in 2007-08 - where we had a tour of New Zealand and Australia (quadrangular series at home in March 2007, also involving England). We had six-seven games and I didn't manage to score a fifty, I think. [She scored one in the 3rd-place playoff that India lost against England].

"And there was one more in 2012, the series against Australia at home. Though it was just three (ODI) games but I didn't manage to score a fifty again. These two periods, these two series were where I felt that somewhere I need to do more than what I have been doing. Because definitely somewhere, something was wrong that I was not able to perform the way I usually did."

The comeback on both occasions, was loaded with runs. Going back to basics helped, she admits. "When in match-mode, each innings where I wasn't getting any runs was only breaking my confidence further. But when I got back home, that's when I took some time off to reflect on what things I have been investing in and what needs to be done more. I used to chalk down a program as to what all I have to work on. By the next matches, whether those were domestic or international, I would come back stronger. That's because I would invest more time in my preparation for the next series."

But despite topping the run charts in England in 2008, a 0-4 drubbing meant Raj was stripped off captaincy rather unceremoniously on return. The baton was passed on to her friend Jhulan Goswami whose career was on an upward curve. When that went downhill, in due course, Anjum Chopra was recalled and handed the duties despite the veteran having spent nearly two years out of the national setup. By 2012, the selectors were forced to acknowledge the unperturbed way in which Raj went about her business. She was back at the helm on the back of consistent performances, but it was her father Dorai Raj who gave her the pep talk when the chips were down and talked her out of early retirement.

"Well, it did cross my mind that I would be left out of the team," she says, reflecting on the infamous captaincy saga of the late 2000s. "I discussed it with my dad. He did tell me that, someone who is thinking of having a long career in the game, all those things are a part of the sport. It is part and parcel of the game. That should not deter one from working hard or trying to change the very basic foundation that you have built so far. So you continue to keep doing that, he said. Of course, the uncertainty was there for a brief period but once again as I started working on my game, I completely overcame that thought," she adds.

Four years down the line, in the aftermath of a promising World T20 campaign that went up in flames prematurely, Raj was once again stripped off the role and Harmanpreet was named her successor in the briefest format. Did the relieval from a job so demanding allow her the luxury to bat carefree, as she fancies? Her cautious-yet-aggressive approach in the recently-concluded Asia Cup in Thailand did suggest so, but Raj begs to differ.

"Well I don't agree to it... I don't think that 'not leading' has made me play freely. The responsibility stays just the same. The expectations are just the same. It is just that I am not leading. Just because I don't have a post, it doesn't reduce the responsibility, it doesn't take away the pressure. It stays still the same. In fact more I would say, because now as a senior player everybody expects me to deliver every match.

"Yeah, the only advantage is that now I get more time to go around the city and have more time to explore the city (laughs). I get more time to read. As a captain you're needed everywhere but as a player you have that sort of free time that you can invest in yourself."
