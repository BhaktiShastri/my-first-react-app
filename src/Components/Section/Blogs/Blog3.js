            Harmanpreet Kaur’s power-hitting and athletic fielding have been at the forefront of revolutionising women’s cricket in India
Growing up in Moga, Punjab, all Harmanpreet Kaur wanted in life was to be a cricketer. Since hardly anyone in her hometown — or most of the country, for that matter — followed women’s cricket at that time, she used to get teased.

“What will you do — open with Sehwag?” her younger brother would ask her.

She may not have walked out to bat with her idol, but the dashing former India opener once tweeted: “An innings of a lifetime, Harmanpreet Kaur...Fan!”

            The very fact that the BCCI has started to think about the possibilities of a women’s league shows how much ground the sport has covered in the country. “Now people are coming out to watch women’s matches and we are covered extensively by the media,” she says. “The quality of our cricket has also improved drastically, the fielding in particular.”

Harmanpreet herself is a prime example of the fast rising standard of India’s fielding. At the beginning of this month, she took an absolute blinder to send back West Indies’ Stafanie Taylor in the first ODI at Antigua. She leapt high into the air and held a one-handed catch at long-on.

It was one of the finest catches you will ever see. Clearly, Harmanpreet knows how to change the game and entertain all at once, even without bat in hand.
